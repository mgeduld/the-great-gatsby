# The Great Gatsby

## Notes 

Identity and *becoming* are very important in both "The Great Gatsby" and the theatre. Perhaps the actors in this play should be cast against type. Anyone could play Gatsby, including a woman. 

Whoever it is, the Gatsby actor should be surprising when revealed ("That's who they cast as Gatsby?"), since, more than anyone in the story, Gatsby reinvents himself. 

The other actors can also be cast against type. Daisy, for instance, could be played by an older actor, a male actor, a Black actor ... 

When using this script, which is largely the text of the novel, productions should grapple with how to handle redundancies. If a bit of narration says that Tom stands, should the actor stand? Perhaps redundancies should be minimized, and only used occasional for comic (or some other) effect. 

One approach is to purposefully create tension between NIck's version of the story and the version the other actors are performing, as if we're seeing multiple "The Great Gatsby"s overlaid, wrestling with each other, sometimes harmonizing each other or commenting on each other. At many instances, the actors can ignore narrative "stage directions." At other times they might outright contradict it. In general, each element (narration, character performance) should  add something new.

All of the stage directions and casting suggestions should be taken as just that: suggestions. And that includes the (usually small, sometimes large) changes to the text. Collaborators on a specific production should refer to the original book and make their own decisions regarding fidelity.

A casting:

ACTOR ONE: Nick

ACTOR TWO: Tom 

ACTOR THREE: Daisy

ACTOR FOUR: Jordan

ACTOR FIVE: Gatsby

ACTOR SIX: Wilson

Most cast members play other characters and, at times, act as a chorus.

## Act One

*[Books everywhere. And readers. ACTOR ONE pulls "The Great Gatsby" from a stack, sits down, and starts reading from it...]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.

**A READER (ACTOR TWO)**
Sh! 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)* *[Quieter, then gradually coming back to full volume]*

“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”

He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. 


*[Some of the READERS move away from him in irritation. He notices]*

In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. 

*[At the mention of Gatsby, the other ACTORS become interested and listen, however, when an actor needs to be "offstage," he can sit quietly and resume reading a book.]*

If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

*[The other ACTORS stand for a family portrait. Perhaps Nick becomes the photographer.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan ...


**POMPOUS CARROWAY (ACTOR TWO)**
And we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
But the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, 


**GRANDFATHER'S BROTHER (ACTOR THREE)** 
who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started a wholesale hardware business  ...


**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... that my father carries on today.

I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me ...

**AUNTS AND UNCLES (ACTORS TWO, THREE, FOUR, and FIVE)**
Gibbity gibbity gibbity gibbity gibbity gibbity gibbity ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... and finally said ...


**AUNTS AND UNCLES (ACTORS TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, and SIX.)**
Why—ye-es, 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)** 
... with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.

The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that ...

**YOUNG MAN (ACTOR THREE)**
...  we take a house together in a commuting town.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow ...

**YOUNG MAN (ACTOR THREE)**
...  at eighty a month.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. 

*[ACTOR FOUR becomes a dog, barking, panting, and running up to Nick]*

I had a dog—

*[The dog leaves]*

... at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.

**FINNISH WOMAN [ACTOR FIVE]**
Finnish wisdom.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.

**SOME MAN (ACTOR SIX)**
How do you get to West Egg village?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... he asked helplessly.

I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood.

*[ACTORS make bird sounds, horn honks, sounds of children playing, etc. as NICK continues]*

And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.

*[ACTOR TWO hands him a book.]*

There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. 

*[As NICK continues, the ACTORS hand him book after book, until he's holding a big stack.]*

I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” 

**COMMENTER (ACTOR FIVE)**
That isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.

*[As Nick reads the following, ACTORS bring in or pull down a large map, using a stick or laser pointer to indicate what he's referring to. Or giving the pointer to NICK and letting him do it.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals

**COMMENTER (ACTOR THREE)**
Like the egg in the Columbus story!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
They are both crushed flat at the contact end. But their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.

I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard...

**LECTURER (ACTOR FOUR)**
... it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was ...

**ACTORS**
An eyesore.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
But it was a small eyesore. And it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires.

**YOUNG MAN (ACTOR THREE)**
All for eighty dollars a month.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with ... 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO) and DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
... the Tom Buchanans. 

*[DAISY (ACTOR THREE) comes forward.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Daisy was my second cousin once removed. 

*[TOM (ACTOR TWO) comes forward.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
And I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.

*[TOM practices his golf swing while Daisy smokes.]*

Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. 

*[TOM flexes his stiff shoulder]*

His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away...

**BREATHLESS COMMENTER (ACTOR FOUR)**
For instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. 

**ACTORS (FIVE AND SIX)**
Woah!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.

*[ACTORS FOUR, FIVE, AND SIX become servants. One hold an ashtray for Daisy. One brings a towel to TOM. One serves drinks.]*

Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
This is a permanent move.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. 

**LECTURER (ACTOR FOUR)**
The lawn starts at the beach and runs towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning garden. And finally when it reaches the house, it drifts up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front is broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
And Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.

*[TOM resumes practicing his swing. Or perhaps shooting, with a servant loading his shotgun.]*

He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.

His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
He seemed to say.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
... just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.

We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
I’ve got a nice place here.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.

Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep ... 

**COMMENTER (ACTOR FOUR)** *[Pointing.]*
A sunken Italian garden.

**COMMENTER (ACTOR FIVE)** *[Pointing.]*
A half acre of deep, pungent roses.

**COMMENTER (ACTOR SIX)** (*[Pointing.]*
And a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
We’ll go inside.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)** 

*[As he and TOM walk around the stage, other actors resume their roles servants or expensive statues. They take Nick's coat, etc.]*

We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.

The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.

*[As NICK speaks about her, JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR) comes forward. A servant hands her a drink. Or, perhaps, if we take her seriously when she (later) says she's not drinking, she looks out the window or smokes, like Daisy.]*

The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless...

*[JORDAN is clearly not lying motionless on the divan, so NICK repeats himself]*

She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless...

*[JORDAN ignores him. He shrugs.]*

... and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.

*[Now DAISY (ACTOR THREE) comes forward]*

The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—

*[She doesn't. Nick notices. Oh well ...]*

...she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
I’m p-paralysed with happiness.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
... There is no one in the world I so much wanted to see. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Baker. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
(I’ve heard it said that ...

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Daisy’s murmur is only to make people lean toward her.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)

At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—

*[JORDAN (ACTOR THREE) turns away from NICK.]*

The object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.

I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ...

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Listen.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.

I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Do they miss me?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Then she added irrelevantly: 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
You ought to see the baby.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
I’d like to.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Never.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Well, you ought to see her. She’s—

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
What you doing, Nick?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
I’m a bond man.

**TOM (ACTOR TOW)**
Who with?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
I told him.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Never heard of them.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
This annoyed me.

*[To TOM]* You will if you stay in the East.

*[SERVANTS (ACTORS FIVE and SIX) serve cocktails]*

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
Absolutely! 

*[ACTORS are startled.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
It was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.

*[What she actually does is the opposite. She sits down. But it has the same sense of breaking from a stance and into a more relaxed state.]*

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
I’m stiff ... 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... she complained.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Don’t look at me. I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.

*[Servant hands her a drink.]*

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
No, thanks. I’m absolutely in training.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
You are?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
How you ever get anything done is beyond me.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
You live in West Egg?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
I know somebody there.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
I don’t know a single—

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
You must know Gatsby.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Gatsby?

**EVERYBODY EXCEPT DAISY**
... demanded Daisy.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)** *[Realizing everyone is staring at her, gaining control of herself]* 
What Gatsby?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Before I could reply that he was my neighbour ...

**BUTLER (ACTOR FIVE)**
Dinner is served.

*[The ACTORS create a dinner table with candles.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.

Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Why candles? 

*[She snaps them out with her fingers]*

In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year. Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
We ought to plan something ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
All right ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... said Daisy. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
What’ll we plan? What do people plan?

*[Of her finger:]*

Look! I hurt it.

*[EVERYONE leans in to look]*

You did it, Tom. I know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
I hate that word ‘hulking,’ even in kidding.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Hulking.

*[TOM, DAISY, and JORDAN eat.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. 

*[NICK turns or crosses away from the table, emphasizing the difference between the East and the West.]*

It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.

*[To DAISY, though he's still not at the table.]* You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy ...

*[To the audience, as he's handed a glass of claret]* I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. 

*[To DAISY]* Can’t you talk about crops or something?

*[To the audience]* I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Civilization’s going to pieces. I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Why, no ...

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)** *[Looking for the book, finding it, and handing it to NICK]*
Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Tom’s getting very profound. He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Well, these books are all scientific. This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
We’ve got to beat them down ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
You ought to live in California—” 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)** *[Taking the book back from Nick]*
The idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—
 
*[He nods towards DAISY, who winks or blows a kiss at NICK.]*

—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately ...

**TELEPHONE (ACTOR SIX)**
Ring ring ring.

*[The BUTLER (ACTOR FIVE), clears his throat and leaves the room. There's a pause.]*

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
I’ll tell you a family secret. It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
That’s why I came over tonight.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
Things went from bad to worse ...

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.

*[During this, the BUTLER (ACTOR FIVE) returns and whispers something to Tom, who rises, throws down his napkin, leaves the room, and embraces the Telephone]*

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)** *[Noticing Tom has left.]*
I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he? 

**JORDAN (ACTOR THREE)**
Mm.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
An absolute rose?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words.

*[Suddenly, DAISY rushes out of the room. The Butler bars her way, stopping her from getting to Tom and the Telephone.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when --

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
“Sh!” 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
*[To JORDAN.]* Is something happening? 

*[To audience.]* I inquired innocently.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
You mean to say you don’t know? I thought everybody knew.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
I don’t.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
Tom’s got some woman in New York.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Got some woman?

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)** *[As DAISY AND TOM return to the table]* 
Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.

**DAISY (ACTOR TREE)**
It couldn’t be helped!

*[A pause.]*

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away. It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Very romantic.  

*[To NICK.]* If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.

**TELEPHONE (ACTOR SIX)**
Ring ring ring.

*[TOM stands. DAISY shakes here head at him. TOM sits.]*

Ring ring ring.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
The subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. 

**TELEPHONE (ACTOR SIX)**
Ring ring ring

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly...

**TELEPHONE (ACTORS FIVE AND SIX)**
Ring ring ring

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... And I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. 

**TELEPHONE (ACTORS FOUR, FIVE, AND SIX)**
Ring ring ring.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. 

**TELEPHONE (EVERYONE except NICK)**
Ring ring ring.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.

*[Everyone leaves the table]*

The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.

*[A servant hands DAISY a drink and offers one to NICK.]*

Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
We don’t know each other very well, Nick ... 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... she said suddenly. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
I wasn’t back from the war.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
That’s true. *[A pause.]* Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Evidently she had reason to be. I waited ... 

But she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. 

*[To DAISY]* I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Oh, yes. *[A pause.]*  Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Very much.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’

You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow. Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything. Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. 

I waited ...

... and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.

*[During the following, JORDAN grabs a book and opens it, sitting down with TOM nearby. DAISY and NICK stroll into the room]*

Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.

When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
To be continued ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... she said, tossing the magazine on the table ...

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
... in our very next issue.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
Ten o’clock ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
 ... she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. 

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
Time for this good girl to go to bed.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow, over at Westchester.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.

*[To the audience.]* 

I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too ...

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
Good night.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... a critical, unpleasant story ...

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

... Good night, Daisy.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... but what it was I had forgotten long ago.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
Wake me at eight, won’t you.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
If you’ll get up.

**JORDON (ACTOR FOUR)**
I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Of course you will.  In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—

**JORDAN (ACTOR THREE)**
Good night ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... called Miss Baker from the stairs. 

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**
I haven’t heard a word.

*[She exits, which might just mean turning her back to the others and reading her book]*

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
She’s a nice girl ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
... said Tom after a moment. 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)** *[Coldly.]*
Who oughtn’t to?

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Her family.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.

*[Daisy and Tom look at each other for a moment in silence.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Is she from New York?

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Did I?” *[She looks at NICK.]* I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called ...

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Wait! I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**
That’s right. We heard that you were engaged.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
It’s a libel. I’m too poor.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
But we heard it. We heard it from three people, so it must be true.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**
Who is she?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.

Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Good night.

*[As NICK continues, DAISY and TOM return inside, where they're served more drinks, and a servant brings in their child, played perhaps by a doll, an empty stroller, or just mimed. Maybe TOM turns on the radio. The scene becomes warm and domestic.]*

Nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.

Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.

I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.
