# The Great Gatsby

By F.Scott Fitzgerald, adapted by Marcus Geduld.

Decated to Elevator Repair Service.

## Notes 

Identity and *becoming* are very important in both "The Great Gatsby" and the theatre. Perhaps the actors in this play should be cast against type. Anyone could play Gatsby, including a woman. 

Whoever it is, the Gatsby actor should be surprising when revealed ("That's who they cast as Gatsby?"), since, more than anyone in the story, Gatsby reinvents himself. 

The other actors can also be cast against type. Daisy, for instance, could be played by an older actor, a male actor, a Black actor ... 

When using this script, which is largely the text of the novel, productions should grapple with how to handle redundancies. If a bit of narration says that Tom stands, should the actor stand? Perhaps redundancies should be minimized, and only used occasional for comic (or some other) effect. 

One approach is to purposefully create tension between NIck's version of the story and the version the other actors are performing, as if we're seeing multiple "The Great Gatsby"s overlaid, wrestling with each other, sometimes harmonizing each other or commenting on each other. At many instances, the actors can ignore narrative "stage directions." At other times they might outright contradict it. In general, each element (narration, character performance) should  add something new.

All of the stage directions and casting suggestions should be taken as just that: suggestions. And that includes the (usually small, sometimes large) changes to the text. Collaborators on a specific production should refer to the original book and make their own decisions regarding fidelity.

A casting:

ACTOR ONE: Nick

ACTOR TWO: Tom 

ACTOR THREE: Daisy

ACTOR FOUR: Jordan

ACTOR FIVE: Gatsby

ACTOR SIX: Wilson

Most cast members play other characters and, at times, act as a chorus.

## Act One

*[Books are everywhere. And readers. ACTOR ONE pulls "The Great Gatsby" from a stack, sits down, and starts reading from it. Throughout the play, ACTOR ONE continues to read from the book, even though he assumes the character of NICK. The rest of the cast perform without reading.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Chapter One.

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.

**A READER (ACTOR TWO)**

Sh! 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)** *[Quieter, then gradually coming back to full volume]*

“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”

He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. 

*[Some of the READERS move away from him in irritation. He notices]*

In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. 

*[At the mention of Gatsby, the other ACTORS become interested and listen, however, when an actor needs to be "offstage," he can sit quietly and resume reading a book.]*

If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

*[The other ACTORS stand for a family portrait. Perhaps Nick becomes the photographer.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan ...


**POMPOUS CARROWAY (ACTOR TWO)**

And we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

But the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, 


**GRANDFATHER'S BROTHER (ACTOR THREE)** 

who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started a wholesale hardware business  ...


**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... that my father carries on today.

I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me ...

**AUNTS AND UNCLES (ACTORS TWO, THREE, FOUR, and FIVE)**

Gibbity gibbity gibbity gibbity gibbity gibbity gibbity ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... and finally said ...


**AUNTS AND UNCLES (ACTORS TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, and SIX.)**

Why—ye-es, 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)** 

... with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.

The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that ...

**YOUNG MAN (ACTOR THREE)**

...  we take a house together in a commuting town.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow ...

**YOUNG MAN (ACTOR THREE)**

...  at eighty a month.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. 

*[ACTOR FOUR becomes a dog, barking, panting, and running up to Nick]*

I had a dog—

*[The dog leaves]*

... at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.

**FINNISH WOMAN [ACTOR FIVE]**

Finnish wisdom.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.

**SOME MAN (ACTOR SIX)**

How do you get to West Egg village?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... he asked helplessly.

I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood.

*[ACTORS make bird sounds, horn honks, sounds of children playing, etc. as NICK continues]*

And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.

*[ACTOR TWO hands him a book.]*

There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. 

*[As NICK continues, the ACTORS hand him book after book, until he's holding a big stack.]*

I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” 

**COMMENTER (ACTOR FIVE)**

That isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.

*[As Nick reads the following, ACTORS bring in or pull down a large map, using a stick or laser pointer to indicate what he's referring to. Or giving the pointer to NICK and letting him do it.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals

**COMMENTER (ACTOR THREE)**

Like the egg in the Columbus story!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

They are both crushed flat at the contact end. But their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.

I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard...

**LECTURER (ACTOR FOUR)**

... it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was ...

**COMMENTERS (ACTORS)**

An eyesore.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

But it was a small eyesore. And it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires.

**YOUNG MAN (ACTOR THREE)**

All for eighty dollars a month.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with ... 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO) and DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

... the Tom Buchanans. 

*[DAISY (ACTOR THREE) comes forward.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Daisy was my second cousin once removed. 

*[TOM (ACTOR TWO) comes forward.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

And I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.

*[TOM practices his golf swing while Daisy smokes.]*

Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. 

*[TOM flexes his stiff shoulder]*

His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away...

**BREATHLESS COMMENTER (ACTOR FOUR)**

For instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. 

**ACTORS (FIVE AND SIX)**

Woah!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.

*[ACTORS FOUR, FIVE, AND SIX become servants. One hold an ashtray for Daisy. One brings a towel to TOM. One serves drinks.]*

Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

This is a permanent move.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. 

**LECTURER (ACTOR FOUR)**

The lawn starts at the beach and runs towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning garden. And finally when it reaches the house, it drifts up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front is broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

And Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.

*[TOM resumes practicing his swing. Or perhaps shooting, with a servant loading his shotgun.]*

He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.

His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

He seemed to say.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

... just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.

We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

I’ve got a nice place here.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.

Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep ... 

**COMMENTER (ACTOR FOUR)** *[Pointing.]*

A sunken Italian garden.

**COMMENTER (ACTOR FIVE)** *[Pointing.]*

A half acre of deep, pungent roses.

**COMMENTER (ACTOR SIX)** (*[Pointing.]*

And a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

We’ll go inside.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)** 

*[As he and TOM walk around the stage, other actors resume their roles servants or expensive statues. They take Nick's coat, etc.]*

We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.

The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.

*[As NICK speaks about her, JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR) comes forward. A servant hands her a drink. Or, perhaps, if we take her seriously when she (later) says she's not drinking, she looks out the window or smokes, like Daisy.]*

The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless...

*[JORDAN is clearly not lying motionless on the divan, so NICK repeats himself]*

She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless...

*[JORDAN ignores him. He shrugs.]*

... and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.

*[Now DAISY (ACTOR THREE) comes forward]*

The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—

*[She doesn't. Nick notices. Oh well ...]*

...she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

I’m p-paralysed with happiness.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

... There is no one in the world I so much wanted to see. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Baker. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

(I’ve heard it said that ...

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Daisy’s murmur is only to make people lean toward her.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)

At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—

*[JORDAN (ACTOR THREE) turns away from NICK.]*

The object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.

I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ...

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Listen.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.

I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Do they miss me?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Then she added irrelevantly: 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

You ought to see the baby.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I’d like to.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Never.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Well, you ought to see her. She’s—

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

What you doing, Nick?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I’m a bond man.

**TOM (ACTOR TOW)**

Who with?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I told him.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Never heard of them.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

This annoyed me.

*[To TOM]* You will if you stay in the East.

*[SERVANTS (ACTORS FIVE and SIX) serve cocktails]*

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Absolutely! 

*[ACTORS are startled.]*


**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

It was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.

*[What she actually does is the opposite. She sits down. But it has the same sense of breaking from a stance and into a more relaxed state.]*

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I’m stiff ... 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... she complained.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Don’t look at me. I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.

*[Servant hands her a drink.]*

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

No, thanks. I’m absolutely in training.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

You are?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

How you ever get anything done is beyond me.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

You live in West Egg?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I know somebody there.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I don’t know a single—

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

You must know Gatsby.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Gatsby?

**EVERYBODY EXCEPT DAISY**

... demanded Daisy.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)** *[Realizing everyone is staring at her, gaining control of herself]* 

What Gatsby?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Before I could reply that he was my neighbour ...

**BUTLER (ACTOR FIVE)**

Dinner is served.

*[The ACTORS create a dinner table with candles.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.

Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Why candles? 

*[She snaps them out with her fingers]*

In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year. Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

We ought to plan something ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

All right ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... said Daisy. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

What’ll we plan? What do people plan?

*[Of her finger:]*

Look! I hurt it.

*[EVERYONE leans in to look]*

You did it, Tom. I know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

I hate that word ‘hulking,’ even in kidding.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Hulking.

*[TOM, DAISY, and JORDAN eat.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. 

*[NICK turns or crosses away from the table, emphasizing the difference between the East and the West.]*

It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.

*[To DAISY, though he's still not at the table.]* You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy ...

*[To the audience, as he's handed a glass of claret]* I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. 

*[To DAISY]* Can’t you talk about crops or something?

*[To the audience]* I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Civilization’s going to pieces. I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Why, no ...

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)** *[Looking for the book, finding it, and handing it to NICK]*

Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Tom’s getting very profound. He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Well, these books are all scientific. This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

We’ve got to beat them down ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

You ought to live in California—” 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)** *[Taking the book back from Nick]*

The idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—
 
*[He nods towards DAISY, who winks or blows a kiss at NICK.]*

—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately ...

**TELEPHONE (ACTOR SIX)**

Ring ring ring.

*[The BUTLER (ACTOR FIVE), clears his throat and leaves the room. There's a pause.]*

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

I’ll tell you a family secret. It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

That’s why I came over tonight.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Things went from bad to worse ...

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.

*[During this, the BUTLER (ACTOR FIVE) returns and whispers something to Tom, who rises, throws down his napkin, leaves the room, and embraces the Telephone]*

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)** *[Noticing Tom has left.]*

I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he? 

**JORDAN (ACTOR THREE)**

Mm.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

An absolute rose?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words.

*[Suddenly, DAISY rushes out of the room. The Butler bars her way, stopping her from getting to Tom and the Telephone.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when --

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

“Sh!” 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

*[To JORDAN.]* Is something happening? 

*[To audience.]* I inquired innocently.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

You mean to say you don’t know? I thought everybody knew.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I don’t.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Tom’s got some woman in New York.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Got some woman?

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)** *[As DAISY AND TOM return to the table]* 

Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.

**DAISY (ACTOR TREE)**

It couldn’t be helped!

*[A pause.]*

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away. It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Very romantic.  

*[To NICK.]* If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.

**TELEPHONE (ACTOR SIX)**

Ring ring ring.

*[TOM stands. DAISY shakes here head at him. TOM sits.]*

Ring ring ring.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. 

**TELEPHONE (ACTOR SIX)**

Ring ring ring

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly...

**TELEPHONE (ACTORS FIVE AND SIX)**

Ring ring ring

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... And I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. 

**TELEPHONE (ACTORS FOUR, FIVE, AND SIX)**

Ring ring ring.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. 

**TELEPHONE (EVERYONE except NICK)**

Ring ring ring.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.

*[Everyone leaves the table]*

The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.

*[A servant hands DAISY a drink and offers one to NICK.]*

Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

We don’t know each other very well, Nick ... 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... she said suddenly. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I wasn’t back from the war.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

That’s true. *[A pause.]* Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Evidently she had reason to be. I waited ... 

But she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. 

*[To DAISY]* I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Oh, yes. *[A pause.]*  Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Very much.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’

You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow. Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything. Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. 

I waited ...

... and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.

*[During the following, JORDAN grabs a book and opens it, sitting down with TOM nearby. DAISY and NICK stroll into the room]*

Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.

When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

To be continued ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... she said, tossing the magazine on the table ...

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

... in our very next issue.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Ten o’clock ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

 ... she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. 

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Time for this good girl to go to bed.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow, over at Westchester.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.

*[To the audience.]* 

I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too ...

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Good night.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... a critical, unpleasant story ...

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

... Good night, Daisy.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... but what it was I had forgotten long ago.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Wake me at eight, won’t you.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

If you’ll get up.

**JORDON (ACTOR FOUR)**

I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Of course you will.  In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—

**JORDAN (ACTOR THREE)**

Good night ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... called Miss Baker from the stairs. 

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I haven’t heard a word.

*[She exits, which might just mean turning her back to the others and reading her book]*

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

She’s a nice girl ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... said Tom after a moment. 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)** *[Coldly.]*

Who oughtn’t to?

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Her family.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.

*[Daisy and Tom look at each other for a moment in silence.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Is she from New York?

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Did I?” *[She looks at NICK.]* I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called ...

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Wait! I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

That’s right. We heard that you were engaged.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

It’s a libel. I’m too poor.

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

But we heard it. We heard it from three people, so it must be true.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. 

**DAISY (ACTOR THREE)**

Who is she?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.

Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Good night.

*[As NICK continues, DAISY and TOM return inside, where they're served more drinks, and a servant brings in their child, played perhaps by a doll, an empty stroller, or just mimed. The scene becomes warm and domestic.]*

*[TOM turns on the radio. Romantic music plays*]

Nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.

Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.

I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.

## Act Two

*[TOM adjust the radio. Static plays. He and the other ACTORS, everyone except for NICK, put on gray coats with hoods. They begin puttin the books into boxes, carrying the boxes from one place to another. Stacking them. If they run out of work, they restack the boxes somwewhere else. This should evoke meanial work in some sort of dreary factory.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**
Chapter Two.

About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.

But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.

The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.

The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.

*[TRAIN WISTLE (ACTOR FIVE) makes a sound]*

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)** *[He has removed his gray coat]*

We’re getting off. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)** 

He insisted.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

I want you to meet my girl.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE** *[As TOM drags him by the arm.]*

I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. 

*[Yanks his arm away]*

The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.

*[Grudgingly follows]*

I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage—Repairs ...

**WILSON (ACTOR SIX)** *[Pulling his hood down but still wearing his gray coat.*]

George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.


**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... and I followed Tom inside.

*[Wilson listlessly sweeps the floor of his shop.]*

The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. 

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Hello, Wilson, old man. *[Slapping Wilson on the back, making him cough]* 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. 

**TOM (ACTOR ONE)**

How’s business?”

**WILSON (ACTOR SIX)**

I can’t complain...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... answered Wilson unconvincingly. 

**WILSON (ACTOR SIX)**

When are you going to sell me that car?

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.

**WILSON (ACTOR SIX)**

Works pretty slow, don’t he?

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

No, he doesn’t. And if you feel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.

**WILSON (ACTOR SIX)**

I don’t mean that. I just meant—

**NICK (ACTOR TWO)**

*[As NICK speaks, MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE) removes her hood, takes out a compact, and applies tastely makeup. The remaining hooded actors take a cigarette break.]*

Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.

**WILSON (ACTOR SIX)**

Oh, sure. 

*[He moves boxes off of chairs and dusts them.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

He went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

I want to see you. Get on the next train.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

All right.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.

*[As MYRTLE, TOM, and NICK leave the shop, WILSON enters carrying two chairs. After a moment, he puts them down and sits in one dejectedly. MYRTLE removes her coat, steps into a tasteless skirt. She checks her hair. TOM drinks from a flask.]* 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track. Tom exchanged frowns with Doctor Eckleburg.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Terrible place, isn’t it ...

*[TOM hands the flask to NICK]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Awful. *[Drinks]*

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

It does her good to get away.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Doesn’t her husband object?

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.

**CONDUCTOR (ACTOR FIVE)**

All abord for Grand Central.

*[WISLON, still seated, becomes a passenger in a train car. All the other ACTORS bring chairs and become passengers, MYRTLE sitting at the opposite end of the car from TOM and NICK]*/

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.

She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. 

*[The ACTORS transform the six-car train into a taxicab with four seats. In the front sit MYRTLE and the DRIVER (ACTOR FIVE), and in the back sit TOM and NICK. ACTORS FOUR AND SIX move clear their chairs from the playing area, grab a couple of boxes, and become dog salesmen.]*

Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

I want to get one of those dogs ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... she said earnestly. 

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

We backed up to a couple of grey old men who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

What kind are they

**DOG SALESMAN 1 (ACTOR SIX)**

All kinds. 

**DOG SALESMAN 2 (ACTOR FOUR)**

Yeah. All kinds.

**DOG SALESMAN 1 (ACTOR SIX)**

What kind do you want, lady?

**DOG SALESMAN 2 (ACTOR FOUR)**

What kind do you want?

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The man peered doubtfully into the basket, 

**DOG SALESMAN 1 (ACTOR SIX)**

Ah! 

*[He pulls a puppy from the box and holds it out, grinning.]*

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

That’s no police dog.

**DOG SALESMAN 1 (ACTOR SIX)**

“No, it’s not exactly a police dog. It’s more of an Airedale.

**DOG SALESMAN 2 (ACTOR FOUR)**

it's an Airdale.

**DOG SALESMAN 1 (ACTOR SIX)**

Look at that coat. 

**DOG SALESMAN 2 (ACTOR FOUR)**

Some coat. 

**DOG SALESMAN 1 (ACTOR SIX)**

That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

I think it’s cute. How much is it?

**DOG SALESMAN 1 (ACTOR SIX)**

That dog?

**DOG SALESMAN 2 (ACTOR FOUR)**

That dog?

**DOG SALESMAN 1 (ACTOR SIX)**

That dog will cost you ten dollars.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Is it a boy or a girl?”

**DOG SALESMAN 2 (ACTOR FOUR)**

That dog? 

**DOG SALESMAN 1 (ACTOR SIX)**

That dog’s a boy.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

It’s a bitch. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

said Tom decisively.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.

*[The DOG SALESMEN cross to the back of the stage, still trying to drum up costumers]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.

“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

No you don’t. Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

“Come on. I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Well, I’d like to, but—

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.

*[They emerge from the cab]*

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

I’m going to have the McKees come up

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

she announced as we rose in the elevator. 

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.

*[As NICK speaks, the rest of the actors create a small, cramped, messy apartment, full of liquor, and the ones not already in character become the party guests: CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR), MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX), and MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE). They laugh, play music, and get up to all kinds of antics. The partying gradually gets more and more out of control, and NICK gets streadily drunker.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door.

*[Nick drinks. Wipes his mouth]*

I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner. 

*[Finds TOM's flash in his pocket. Downs the contents.]*

When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.

Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door.

The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I asked if she lived here. 

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

Do I live here? He wants to know do I live here? I live with a girlfriend at a hotel!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the ...

**MR. KCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

Artistic game.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

...and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with pride that ...

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

My husband has photographed me a hundred and twenty-seven times!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

My dear ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... she told her sister in a high, mincing shout ...

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

... most of these fellas will cheat you every time. 

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

All they think of is money. 

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

What was the name of the woman?

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

I like your dress. I think it’s adorable.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**.

This? It’s just a crazy old thing.  just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean. If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.

**MR. KCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

I should change the light. I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

I wouldn’t think of changing the light. I think it’s—

**MR. KCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

Sh! 

*[MR. MCKEE frames MYRTLE with his hands. TOM yawns and stands up.]*

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

You McKees have something to drink. And get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

I told that boy about the ice. 

*[Everybody drinks. TOM puts on music. He and MYRTLE dance]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

*[Shouting over the music]* 

Mrs. Wilson looked at me and laugted pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstacy, and --

*[Catherine snatches the book out of Nick's hand. She tosses it to MRS. MCKEE who tosses it to TOM. TOM gives it to DAISY who hides it.]* 

Wait. Wait. Wait! No.

*[As NICK is shouting, the others all laugh and yell out teases. speaking at the same time.]

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

Whoop!

**MRS. KCKEE (ACTOR FOUR)**

You don't need this!

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Give it a rest.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Bye bye book.

*[NICK covers his face with his hands. Catherine grabs his hands away and kisses him. She climbs on top of him, making out with him in a sloppy way, getting lipstick all over his face.]*

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

*[Shouting to TOM]* I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

What things?

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

Two of them we have framed downstairs.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)** 

*[He stops dancing]*

Two what?

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

*[Breaks off her assault on NICK and interrogates him]* Do you live down on Long Island, too?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

*[Looks for his book. Gives up. Improvises*] I live at ... East ... No! ... West Egg.

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I ...I live next door to him.

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. 

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

That’s where all his money comes from.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Really?

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.

*[Nick starts hunting for the book]*

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

*[Of Catherine.]* Chester, I think you could do something with her!

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

What I’d like to do is more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. *[To Tom]* All I ask is that they should give me a start.

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

Ask Myrtle. She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**.

Do what?

**TOM (ACTOR TWO)**

You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.  ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Can’t they?

*[Nick finds the book. He thumbs through it, looking for his page.]

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

Can’t stand them. And what I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Doesn’t she like Wilson either?

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Like him? Like him? *[Shouting]* I hate that fucking shitheel of a pansy! 

[A pause.]

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

You see. t’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

*[Reading from the book again.]* Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

When they do get married, they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

Oh, do you like Europe? I just got back from Monte Carlo.

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

Really?

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

Just last year. I went over there with another girl.

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

Stay long?

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then ...

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

I almost made a mistake, too. I almost married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Yes, but listen. At least you didn’t marry him.

**MRS. MCKEE (ACTOR FIVE)**

I know I didn’t.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Well, I married him. And that’s the difference between your case and mine.

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

Why did you, Myrtle? Nobody forced you to.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

I married him because I thought he was a gentleman. I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

You were crazy about him for a while.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Crazy about him! Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.

*[She points at NICK. Everyone turns to look at him.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Um. *[At a loss, he flips through his book, trying to find something to say.]*

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

*[To NICK]* She really ought to get away from him. They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who ... 

**CATHERINE (ACTOR FOUR)**

... Feels just as good on nothing at all ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.

Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ 

[To MRS. KCKEE] My dear! I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.”

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.

The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.

**MYRTLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! I’ll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai—

*[TOM hits her, hard]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed. As we groaned down in the elevator, he suggested ...

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

Come to lunch some day

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Where?

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

Anywhere.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

“Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

I beg your pardon ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... said Mr. McKee with dignity ...

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

I didn’t know I was touching it. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

He thought for a moment.

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

We can get two egg-salad sandwiches. And two malteds.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

All right. I’ll be glad to.

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

Pickles.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Then. I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.

**MR. MCKEE (ACTOR SIX)**

Beauty and the Beast… Loneliness… Old Grocery Horse… Brook’n Bridge…

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for the four o’clock train.

## Act Three

*[The ACTORS are all passed out from the party. One of them reaches up a hand and manages to turn on the radio, which plays ubpeat, party music. This rouses the ACTORS who--with the exception of NICK--become servants, rearranging the furniture into the interior of GATSBY'S mansion. They set up the boxed books on neat bookshelves (or turn the boxes themselves into bookshelves). As NICK speaks, one by one, they change from sevants to guests, until everyone is mingling, holding cocktail glasses, smoking cigarettes in holders, laughing, and enjoying themselves.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

There was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.

Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb.

At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.

By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.

The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light.

Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.

*[An ACTOR becomes a servant, and NICK hands him his book. The SERVANT holds the book so NICK can see it and read from it while he changes into his party clothes. Alternatively, NICK holds his book and reads while the SERVANT dresses him]*

I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited—they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.

I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.

*[NICK wanders amongst the guests, who mostly ignore him.]*

Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.

As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.

I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.

Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.

“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I thought you might be here ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... she responded absently as I came up. 

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I remembered you lived next door to—

*[A GIRL, coming forward with her FRIEND, taps JORDAN on the shoulder. JORDAN takes NICK's hand as a promise she'll take care of him in a minute and turns to the GIRL.]*

**GIRL (ACTOR THREE)**

Hello! 

**FRIEND (ACTOR SIX)**

Sorry you didn’t win.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.

**GIRL (ACTOR THREE)**

You don’t know who we are, but--

**FRIEND (ACTOR SIX)**

We met you here about a month ago.

*[The GIRL and her FRIEND smile and leave.]*

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

You’ve dyed your hair since then ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... remarked Jordan, and I started, but her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. 

*[JORDAN smiles at NICK and takes his arm.]*

We descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the a girl in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as ...

**MR. MUMBLER 1 (ACTOR TWO)**

Mr. Mumble.

**MR. MUMBLER 2 (ACTOR SIX)**

Mr. Mumble.

**MR. MUMBLER 3 (ACTOR FIVE)**

Mr. Mumble.

*[They shake hands with NICK and JORDAN]*

**MISS MUMBLE (ACTOR THREE)**
Miss Mumble.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

*[To MISS MUMBLE]* Do you come to these parties often?

**MISS MUMBLE (ACTOR THREE)**

The last one was the one I met you at. Wasn’t it for you, Lucille? Lucille?

*[She can't find her friend. Shurgs.]*

I like to come. I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Did you keep it?

**MISS MUMBLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.

**MR. MUMBLE 2 (ACTOR SIX)**

There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that. He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Who doesn’t?

**MISS MUMBLE (ACTOR THREE)**

Gatsby. Somebody told me --

*[She looks over his shoulder and everyone leans in.]*

Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.

**MR MUMBLE 1 (ACTOR TWO)**

I don’t think it’s so much that. It’s more that he was a German spy during the war.

**NICK (ACTOR TWO)**

A spy?

**MR. MUMBLER 1 (ACTOR TWO)**

I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany.

**MR MUMBLE 2 (ACTOR SIX)**

Oh, no. It couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war. 

**MISS MUMBLE (ACTOR THREE)**

You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

She narrowed her eyes and shivered. 

*[The MUMBLES and JORDAN scatter.]*

We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.

**BUTLER (ACTOR SIX)**

Ladies and Gentlemen: the first supper—

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

there would be another one after midnight.

**BUTLER (ACTOR SIX)**

is now being served.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

*[As he speaks, he walks into a group: JORDAN, a HUSBAND, his WIFE, and an UNDERGRADUATE.]*

And Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety.

**WIFE (ACTOR THREE)**

On our way here, Charles and I saw the most adorable child tilling a field.

**HUSBAND (ACTOR TWO)**

*[To JORDAN and NICK]* My wife has an abiding interest in crops.

**UNDERGRADUATE (ACTOR SIX)**

What do you think of Agrarianism, Miss Baker?

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

*[To NICK]* Let’s get out. This is much too polite for me.

*[The others SCATTER. NICK and JORDAN look for GATSBY and then JORDAN searches by herself.]*

We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.

The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.

A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

What do you think?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

About what?

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

*[Indicating the bookshelves.]* About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

The books?

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you. Look. Here's Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.

*[He hands the book to NICK]*

See! It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?

*[Taking the wrong book back...]*

Here. Give that to me.  If one brick was removed the whole library is liable to collapse.

*[NICK takes his puts the Stoddard book back on the shelf and takes back his own.]*

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

*[Extending her hand]* I don't think we've had the pleasure--

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

Who brought you? Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

We--

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt. Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Has it?

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

You told us.

*[NICK and JORDAN turn away from the DRUNK MAN who melts back into the party. As does JORDAN.]*

We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.

*[NICK comes downstage and reads the following. Behand him, the guests get drunker and crazier, not literally acting out what he describes, but behaving in ways that augmentit. Perhaps all dancing together.]*

There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.

*[GATSBY comes downstage and sits near NICK.]*

I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.

At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE) AND NICK (ACTOR TWO) **

“Your face is familiar,” 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... he said politely. 

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE) AND NICK (ACTOR TWO) **

“Weren’t you in the First Division during the war?”

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

What time?

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

Any time that suits you best.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when --

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

*[Emerging from the crowd]*

Having a gay time now?

*[She rejoins the crowd]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Much better. 

I turned again to my new acquaintance. 

*[To GATSBY]* This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there ... 

I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, 

... and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.

*[A pause.]*

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

I’m Gatsby.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

What! Oh, I beg your pardon.

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. 

*[The PARTIERS turn so they're facing away from NICK and GATSBY. GATSBY comes down in front of NICK, facing him, his back to the audience. He's relating to NICK only. The music changes.]*

It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. 

*[GATSBY returns to the reality of the moment, standing, about to leave. The PARTIERS turn back around.]*

Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.

Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

If you want anything just ask for it, old sport.

*[With a little bow of his head, GATSBY leaves. He stands to the side somewhere, watching the party but not participating or just talking to a guest, quietly.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

*[Appearing by his side.]*

The man is full of surprises.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Who is he? Do you know?

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Just a man named Gatsby.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Now you’re started on the subject... 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... she answered with a wan smile. 

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

However, I don’t believe it.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Why not?

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Anyhow, he gives large parties ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.

**ORCHESTRA LEADER (ACTOR SIX)**

Ladies and gentlemen. At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

He smiled with jovial condescension, and added .. 

**ORCHESTRA LEADER (ACTOR SIX)**

Some sensation!

*[The PARTIERS laugh and clap.]*

**ORCHESTRA LEADER (ACTOR SIX)**

The piece is known as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World!’ 

A one! A two! A one, two three ...

*[He raises his hands to conduct and freezes. The PARTIERS do, too.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

*[As GATSBY comes down stage. He and NICK reverse their previous positions, with NICK coming down further in front of him, back to the audience, like a spotlight pointing at GATSBY.]*

The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World” was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.

*[The guests are all seated and GATSBY moves upstage, his back to the audience.]*

**A BUTLER (ACTOR TWO)**

*[The actor can say this his lines from wherever he is on stage.]*

I beg your pardon.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.

**A BUTLER (ACTOR TWO)**

Miss Baker? I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

*[From wherever she is on stage.]*

With me?

**A BUTLER (ACTOR TWO)**

Yes, madame.

*[JORDAN rises and walks towards GATSBY. The other ACTORS form a wall, backs turned to the audience, separating JORDAN and GATSBY from NICK.]*

As she followed the Butler, I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.

I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.

The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that ...

**HUMOROUS GUEST (ACTOR TWO)**

*[Turning to face front.]*

...she should sing the notes on her face

*[Turning to back.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.

**GOSSIPY GUEST (ACTOR SIX)**

*[Turning to face front.]*

She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband.

*[Turning to back.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed ... 

**ANGRY WIFE (ACTOR THREE)**

*[Turning to face front.]*

You promised!

*[Turning to back.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.

**INDIGNANT WIFE 1 (ACTOR TWO)**

*[Turning to face front.]*

Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.

**INDIGNANT WIFE 2 (ACTOR SIX)**

*[Turning to face front.]*

Never heard anything so selfish in my life.

**INDIGNANT WIFE 1 (ACTOR TWO)**

We’re always the first ones to leave.

**INDIGNANT WIFE 2 (ACTOR SIX)**

So are we.

**HER HUSNAMD (ACTOR TWO)**

*[Turning to face front.]*

Well, we’re almost the last tonight. The orchestra left half an hour ago.

*[All three turn back.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.

*[The wall breaks apart, and we see GATSBY kissing JORDAN's hand, Then the PARTIERS, except for JORDAN, surround GATSBY.]*

As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.

Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.

*[JORDAN comes forward to NICK.]*

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I’ve just heard the most amazing thing. How long were we in there?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Why, about an hour.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

It was… simply amazing. *[A pause.]*. But I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

She yawned gracefully in my face. 

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Please come and see me… Phone book… Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard… My aunt… 

*[She leaves and joins the cluster arond GATSBY.]*

Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.

*[NICK stayes downstage, but the cirlc around GATSBY parts a little, so that he can address NICK, as if they're standing togethger.]*

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

Don’t give it another thought, old sport. 

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. 

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine o’clock.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Then the butler, behind his shoulder, said, “Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there… Good night.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Good night.

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE)**

Good night. 

*[He turns his back.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. 

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE) and NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

"Good night, old sport… Good night.”

*[The circle closes around him,]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.

A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

*[Turning to face front]*

It went in the ditch.

*[He stumbles backwards. The others in the circle catch him and hold him up. Except for GATSBY who is upstage of them, back turned.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.

“How’d it happen?”

He shrugged his shoulders.

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

I know nothing whatever about mechanics.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

Don’t ask me. I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

But I wasn’t even trying. I wasn’t ... even ... trying.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

“Do you want to commit suicide? You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”

**DRUNK MAN (ACTOR TWO)**

You don’t understand. I wasn’t driving. There’s another man in the car.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.

*[One of PARTIERS holding up the DRUNK MAN becomes the DRIVER, staggering downstage, in front of the DRUNK MAN and his handlers but still upstage of NICK.]*

Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.

**DRIVER (ACTOR SIX)**

Wha’s matter? Did we run outa gas?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.

“It came off,” someone explained.

[A pause.]

**DRIVER (ACTOR SIX)**

At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.

*[He takes a long breath and straightens his shoulders]*

Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.

**DRIVER (ACTOR SIX)**

Back out ...

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

... he suggested after a moment.

**DRIVER (ACTOR SIX)**

Put her in reverse.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

“But the wheel’s off!”

**DRIVER (ACTOR SIX)**

“No harm in trying.

*[He shrugs and rejoins the circle. The DRUNKEN MAN and his handlers straighten up, and in slow motionm, the PARTIERS back away from the circle, leaving GATSBY alone.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch ...

**GATSBY (ACTOR FIVE) and NICK (ACTOR TWO)**

... his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.

*[GATSBY turns and walks upstage, his back to the audience.]*

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.

*[Nick grabs a chair and sits in the middle of the stage, as at a desk in his office.]*

Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.

I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.

I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.

Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.

*[JORDAN walks behind NICK, hands on his shoulders.]*

For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.

*[JORDAN playes with his hair, caresses his face.]*

Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.

It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

"You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I am careful.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

No, you’re not.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

Well, other people are.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

What’s that got to do with it?

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

They’ll keep out of my way. It takes two to make an accident.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.

**JORDAN (ACTOR FOUR)**

I hope I never will. I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.

**NICK (ACTOR ONE)**

Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. 

*[Nick stands and moves away from JORDAN, who, after a moment, moves to the edge of the stage, taking the chair with her.]*

But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.

*[Not read from the book.]*

Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.
